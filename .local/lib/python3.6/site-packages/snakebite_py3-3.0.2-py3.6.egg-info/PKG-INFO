Description: üêç About This Forküç¥
        --------------------
        This is a fork of https://github.com/spotify/snakebite, via
        https://github.com/kirklg/snakebite/tree/feature/python3. We maintain it
        enough to work for our needs at the Internet Archive. As of April 10 2019,
        some tests are not passing, and we don't have resources to spend fixing
        them. We use the library with our CDH5 cluster and have not tested it with
        any other versions of hadoop. Please help us improve this! Or make your own
        fork. No hard feelings.

        Snakebite is a python library that provides a pure python HDFS client
        and a wrapper around Hadoops minicluster. The client uses protobuf for
        communicating with the NameNode and comes in the form of a library and a
        command line interface. Currently, the snakebite client supports most
        actions that involve the Namenode and reading data from DataNodes.
        
        *Note:* all methods that read data from a data node are able to check
        the CRC during transfer, but this is disabled by default because of
        performance reasons. This is the opposite behaviour from the stock
        Hadoop client.
        
        ~Snakebite requires python2 (python3 is not supported yet)~ and
        python-protobuf 2.4.1 or higher.
        
        Snakebite 1.3.x has been tested mainly against Cloudera CDH4.1.3 (hadoop
        2.0.0) in production. Tests pass on HortonWorks HDP 2.0.3.22-alpha
        (protocol versions 7 and 8)
        
        Snakebite 2.x has been tested on Hortonworks HDP2.0 and CDH5 Beta and
        ONLY supports Hadoop 2.2.0 and up (protocol version 9)!
